flappy bird NEAT neural network plan

inputs:
y position of the bird
distance to top pipe
distance to bottom pipe

outputs:
jump or don't jump - 1 neuron

activation function:
NEAT will pick activation functions for hidden layers
my activation function will be tanH - the larger the positive x, the closer to 1 the y gets and the smaller the x, the closer to -1 the y gets
keeps the values between 1 and -1
we will check- if the value is greater than 0.5, jump, otherwise don't

population size:
between 100-150 (i will experiment with this number)
	note: upon testing, 100 was too many for such a simple game, as an optimal neural network was found by chance in the first generation
	as this would not be efficient in more complex solutions, i have reduced the population to 20 so that neural evolution will occur rather than relying on chance

fitness function:
evaluates how well each bird has performed- it should find the best bird so that the best birds will breed
the birds that make it the furthest in the level will be the best

max generations:
a cap on generations so that if the ai fails to develop it will start over
i will set 40 as my maximum
